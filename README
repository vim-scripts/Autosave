When Vim cashes, you can recover file contents from swap file, the auto backup files can save your life, too.

But if you accidentally confirmed to quit an unnamed buffer, there's no regret pill.

So this is the very simple plugin to automatically save empty buffer to backup path, you don't need to save new buffer mannually every time.
